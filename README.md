**📊 Order Summary – Power BI Dashboard**

Welcome to Order Summary, a dynamic and insightful Power BI dashboard designed to analyze sales data across global markets, product categories, and customer segments. As an advanced beginner in data analytics, this project allowed me to apply my growing skills in data modeling, visualization, and storytelling to extract meaningful business insights from transactional data.

**🔍 Overview**
This dashboard was created using a sample dataset that captures transactional sales data from diverse markets such as the US, APAC, EMEA, EU, LATAM, and Africa. It includes granular details across various product sub-categories (e.g., Phones, Chairs, Accessories), shipping modes, and customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).

The objective of this dashboard is to provide an interactive summary of sales, profits, and order performance, enabling stakeholders to make quick and effective business decisions.

**📈 Key Metrics and Visualizations**
The dashboard highlights the following core KPIs:

**Sales:** Total revenue from each product or region.

**Profit:** Net profit after considering discounts and shipping costs.

**Order Quantity:** Total number of units sold.

**Shipping Cost:** Costs incurred for order delivery.

**Discount:** Applied discounts on transactions.

Using these KPIs, I created 7 key charts for detailed performance analysis:

Segment Analysis: Sales, profit, and quantity broken down by customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).

Category Analysis: Visual comparison of performance across the main product categories (Technology, Furniture, Office Supplies).

Market Analysis: Insights into how different markets are contributing to overall performance.

Top 5 Sub-Categories: Identifies the top-performing sub-categories based on selected KPIs.

Bottom 5 Sub-Categories: Highlights underperforming sub-categories to focus improvement efforts.

Top 10 Countries by Sales: A world map visualization showcasing countries that generate the highest revenue.

Regional Market Share: Pie chart showing the sales contribution of each global region.

**🧮 Interactive Filters (Slicers)**
To enhance the user experience, I implemented several slicer panels that allow users to slice and dice data by:

Market

Sub-Category

Customer Segment

Ship Mode

These slicers make the dashboard interactive and customizable, helping stakeholders drill down into specific regions, product lines, or shipping methods.

**🧠 Insights & Use Cases**
Identify high- and low-performing sub-categories to adjust marketing or procurement strategies.

Compare profitability across shipping modes to optimize logistics.

Understand regional market share and strategize geographic expansion.

Explore sales trends by segment to better understand customer behavior.

**🚀 Future Enhancements**
Add forecasting models for sales and profit using DAX and Power BI’s AI capabilities.

Enable real-time updates by connecting to live databases or APIs.


Include customer segmentation and churn analysis to enrich business insights.

Develop mobile-optimized views for better accessibility on smaller devices.
